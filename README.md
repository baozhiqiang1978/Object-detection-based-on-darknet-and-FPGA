# Use Darknet on FPGA
This project aims to implement darknet on FPGA to realise rel-time object detection and image classification.
The original darknet frame is based on CPU and GPU, FPGA is much efficient and consumes much less power resource. Use FPGA for deep learning is a popular trend. 
## Hardware details
FPGA: FA510Q
Memory: 1.5T SSD and 6T HD
## Implementation details
This project is still under constructing, please refer to the technical report for more information:
